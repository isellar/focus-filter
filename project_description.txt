🔍 Problem Statement
Modern smartphone users are overwhelmed by a constant stream of notifications from apps, services, and systems.
These alerts vary drastically in importance and while some require immediate attention, many are low-value distractions or informational noise. In many cases a single application will have multiple categories of notification with no way to distinguish between them without the user reading and digesting the information themself.
This overload negatively impacts productivity, focus, and mental clarity.

The problem:
There is no intelligent, personalized system that automatically interprets, filters, and acts on notifications based on a user’s priorities.

Why it matters:

The average person receives 40–100+ notifications per day.
Most are irrelevant in the moment.
Even tiny interruptions break workflow and attention cycles.
Users need an automated agent that works as a cognitive shield, surfacing what matters now, storing what matters later and blocking what doesn't.
Focus Filter addresses this gap by creating an autonomous system that routes notifications intelligently and reduces distraction.

🤖 Why Agents?
Agents are uniquely suited to solve this problem because they can:

1. Perceive
They ingest raw notifications, inspect content, and understand the underlying intent using natural-language reasoning.

2. Decide
Agents can classify each notification as urgent, irrelevant, or informational through multi-step reasoning, few-shot examples, and user preferences.

3. Act
Unlike a simple classifier, agents can:

trigger tools,
suppress output,
store knowledge,
summarize long-term patterns,
and escalate emergencies.
This ties directly into agentic loops:

Get the Mission: The notification is the mission.
Think It Through: The model reasons about urgency and context.
Take Action: The agent passes, blocks, or stores it.
Observe & Learn: Less urgent notifications enrich long-term memory and improve behavior over time.
Agents provide both autonomy and adaptability, making them an ideal solution for personalized notification management.

Core components:
Notification Ingestion Tool: Simulated pipeline for feeding alerts into the agent.
LLM Reasoning Core: Classifies urgency using rules, examples, preferences, and context.
Execution Tools:
display_urgent_notification()
block_notification()
save_notification_memory()
Memory Manager:
extraction → consolidation → long-term storage
Observability & Evaluations:
traces, logs, LLM-as-judge, golden test suites
The result is a Level-2 Strategic Problem-Solver with autonomous filtering, long-term learning, and safe decision boundaries.

🎥 Demo — How Focus Filter Works
Example scenario:

Input Notification:
“Your project deadline has moved to Tuesday.”

The agent reasons:

Is this urgent? Not immediate.
Is it irrelevant? No.
Should it be stored? Yes — meaningful, future-relevant detail.
Action:

Extracts key fact
Updates memory store
Nothing is shown to the user immediately
Another example:

Input Notification:
“3 new people liked your photo.”

The agent:

Classifies as irrelevant social noise
Blocks it without surfacing to the user
Urgent example:

Input Notification:
“Your bank flagged suspicious activity on your account.”

The agent:

Recognizes high-priority context
Calls urgent alert tool
Immediately displays/highlights to user
This demo flow shows the agent’s autonomy, reasoning, and tool-use loop.

⏳ If I Had More Time, I Would…
1. Add Personalization Loops
Teach the agent user preferences automatically, such as:

“Always notify me about finance alerts.”
“Never block messages from family.”
“Summaries only after work hours.”
2. Integrate Real Device Notifications
Move beyond simulated input to:

Android notification listeners
iOS push-forwarding via app extension
3. Build a Dashboard
Provide:

Daily summaries
Memory graph visualization
Notification breakdown analytics
4. Add Multi-Agent Coordination
Separate agents for:

Priority detection
Memory optimization
Safety filtering
User preference tuning
5. Develop Real-Time Evaluation
Allow the system to self-correct using reinforcement signals (thumbs up/down).

6. Integrate with other Tools
Allow the system to handle notifications automatically using tools like calendars, email/sms sending, and home automation
